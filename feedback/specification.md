Project Spec Feedback
=====================

### Product Backlog (10/10)

### Data Models (10/10)
 * -0, From my understanding, ForumModerator is a user with high permission level. Then should user be a OneToOneField in ForumModerator instead of ForeignKey?

### Wireframes or Mock-ups (9/10)
 * -1, You didn't include your login/register pages.
