### Paul

I would challenge you before writing your final specifications to try to differentiate your project a little more from Grumblr. I think it is possible to do so, just make sure you include enough different features and ideas, while still demonstrating overall knowledge of the course concepts. Maybe think about some possible APIs you could use for such an app--maybe think about how you could incorporate APIs such as Google Maps, for example, in a section for users to share events.

### Andrew

I think your project has a reasonable scope, and most of the goals in the "Main Features Section" seam reasonable. One issue I'm a little concerned abot though is that your goals of "writing short messages to each other" doesn't really seem like a "main" feature, since my impressions of your site is that it's a form first, and communication between users is more often going to be on the forum itself. Also, you might want to rething your proposed usage of sqlite, as while that might be OK for local projects, most online web hosters will intregrate better with Postgresql and Mysql (or any database of your choice). Your extra goals aren't particularly hard either, so it might be worth taking a look at forum/social network like sites you use, and see what features they have/you'd like them to have and see if they work for your project.

### Shuai

Your project size sounds appropriate to me. Several things you need to note though. It sounds like your proposed application is close to grumblr, can you propose more features to distinguish it? You could also use other social network's APIs to support login and sharing using your Facebook/Google+ accounts. You should not use SQLite for this application, but rather a more robust industry-standard database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
